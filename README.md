CPSC 483 - Intro to Machine Learning
Project 4 - Handwritten Digit Recognition

In this assignment, you are asked to design and develop artificial neural network models
that can classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset
consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is a
small 28x28 (784) pixels grayscale digit between 0 and 9. You can use a Python
library to download this dataset.

From this assignment, you will also learn how to process and compute images,
and design multilayer backpropagation perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) architectures
